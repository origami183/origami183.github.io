While the main page acts mostly as a way to access any web app(s) I publish, the main one is my D&D Character Sheet App.
Each app will receive a dedicated section within this file.

# Character Sheet:
This page functions as a way to create and store Character Sheets for Dungeons & Dragons 5th & 2024 Editions.
Main Features include: saving sheets to local storage, export/import functionality via JSON files, & dark mode toggle.

Notable features about the sheet itself: auto updating fields for related values, dynamic tables for weapons & spells, and simple, easy-to-follow layout of fields.

How to use:
- All non-checkbox fields accept either only numbers or any text. If a field does not accept non-numerical input, it is a number field, otherwise, it is a text field.
- Checkboxes (outside of Death Save/Fails) act as a way to indicate proficiency with an attribute or skill, select the box only if proficiency is applicable.
	- Note: Skills have a second checkbox for expertise. Again, only use if applicable.
- Save will save the sheet to local storage after accepting a name to save as.
- Export downloads the currently selected sheet as a JSON file.
- Import allows the upload of a single JSON file to (should only accept valid sheet files).
- New Sheet resets all values back to defaults (clear all button, be sure to save anything important).
- Delete deletes a sheet saved to local storage.
- Toggle Dark Mode swaps the page between light & dark mode.
